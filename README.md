BTC-E-Ticker
============

Just a basic Ticker / ASIC Hashing reader / PiGlow feedback.

Assuming you have API turned on in cgminer.

Pretty basic. Free to take whatever you want, leave the rest.

The piglow.py library has been borrowed from https://github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow and remains fully intact. If you need any help setting it up, suggest you check that link.
